I have been working in the Data Science since 2017. Enjoy writing short tutorials. Recently have been involved in teaching Data Science [courses](https://devrepublik.com/data-science/) (online and offline). Personal area of interest is how computer science can boost healthcare field. I like both R and Python the same.

My life credo is "Never stop learning". When I am not learning, I am travelling or hiking.
