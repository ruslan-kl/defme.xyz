I have been working in the Data Science field for almost three years. Have experience with Python, R, SQL, statistical analysis, data visualization, classification/regression models, computer vision. Feel passionate about the combination of neuroscience domain and data science. My life credo is "Never stop learning". When I am not learning, I am travelling or hiking.
